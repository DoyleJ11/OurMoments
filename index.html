                    <h1>Drive-in date</h1>
                    <p>It was our first date back after six months apart. I remember us being awkward at the start of the 
                        car ride there, obviously not used to talking in person again, but we quickly got it back to normal.
                        I remember I didn't tell my parents I was going off the island with you because I didn't want them to 
                        say no. This was when I told you I loved you for the first time, shortly before your infamous "no". This
                        was the date that I knew for a fact that we had something special, this was the date where I confirmed
                        my feelings for you were beyond just online but also in person. Our chemistry was even better than when
                        we we're just friends and that meant I couldn't help but fall in love with you.
                    </p>

                <h1>Valentines Date</h1>
                <p>You had to work on Valentines day so we decided to celebrate the day before by going to Seattle. We planned on going to the Van Gogh
                    Museum, but before we got there we had to make a boba stop of course. I don't usually like museums but we both really 
                    enjoyed it. We eventually went to the big projector room and you setup your phone to take pictures every few seconds. 
                    After that we got an Uber back to the dock and decided to head to the ferris wheel. This was one of my favorite
                    experiences I've had with you. I'm so glad I have memories like this one to look back on when I get lonely because it helps
                    to remind me how worthwhile long distance is for someone like you.

            <h1>Seattle Trip</h1>
            <p>We both were doing nothing on boring old bainbridge so we decided to take a little day trip to seattle. We went without anything
               specific in mind but I had a really good day. We started off by going to Pikes Place to walk around. I got pretty flowers
               for my pretty girlfriend and we continued to stroll through the market. After that we went to beechers cheese and you bought me
               cheese because you love me :D. We eventually went to go sit on the grass outside and took these cute pictures togther. 
               We ended up staying long enough that we got the chance to greet your grandparents who just flew in. We went to get your
               family some fish and chips from Ivar's while they were in the ferry line and it was the first time I got to meet them. I 
               don't think I've ever seen you have such a radiating smile, it warmed my heart :).

            <h1>Disney Date</h1>
            <p>Our first of hopefully many trips and adventures together. You came with me and my family for a big reunion at
                Disneyland. I know you were nervous to meet my family but I was really excited to introduce you to everyone and
                you fit in perfectly. Everyone really liked you :). You had really cute outfits every day and I remember how much
                I laughed and smiled while enjoying your company. I never wanted it to end, being with you just felt right. I wouldn't
                have enjoyed it nearly as much as I did if it hadn't been for you joining me. I love you so much and I can't wait to 
                travel with you again &#10084; PS: You don't need to pay my parents back. Stop being silly :))

            <h1>Prom &#10084;</h1>
            <p>As you know, I wasn't really looking forward to prom. I was very excited to dress up and spend time with my beautiful
                girlfriend, but the more social aspect isn't for me. That being said, I had a lot of fun with you during prom! 
                We went to a fancy restaurant in Seattle for dinner and it was really yummy. After dinner we went to Kylie's older brothers
                apartment in downtown seattle for some pictures and to relax before prom started. We hung out for a while and eventually got to slow dance, 
                something I dreaded because I'm an awful dancer but in the end really enjoyed. The highlight of the night for me was the ferry ride back. 
                We went outside together and enjoyed each others company. I'll never forget laughing with you and holding you looking out at the distant 
                Seattle skyline together. You mean the world to me and I love you so much.

            <h1>My Birthday</h1>
            <p>I had no plans for my birthday and apparently that was unacceptable to you lol. I was going to spend it with you at home 
                because my parents were out of town and I didn't really care to plan anything. Luckily my girlfriend is the best ever and
                planned an entire picnic for us to enjoy. I was blown away with how caring and thoughtful it was, especially your gifts.
                You got me more cologne and some yummy chocolates ;). The best part by far however was the food. You not only got me pizza
                from my favorite pizza place but you also got me sushi AND you baked heart shape mini berry pies. Not to mention, this was
                the date that we took the polaroids in our phone cases. I'm so glad we did because it makes showing off my pretty girlfriend
                so easy :D. I am so incredibly thankful to have such a beautiful, caring and talented girlfriend. I hope one day I can make 
                you feel as loved as you made me feel.

            <h1>Sunflower Fields</h1>
            <p style="font-size: 18px;">This was without a doubt my favorite date. We went to Seattle and took an uber to the airport to pickup the car my mom 
                left in the parking lot. We drove the car about an hour out to Maris Farms for their sunflower festival. When we got there
                we found out there were a bunch of activities and we both got to take home one sunflower each. The fields were beautiful,
                I never knew there were so many different types and colors of sunflower. It was also a perfect day out, the sun was shining
                and the clouds made the sky look amazing. You were wearing a cute white and blue dress, you looked gorgeous. We set up
                your phone to take pictures of us on the bed of a truck while we goofed around with the beautiful sky behind us. We watched
                the sky light up in a soft red color as the sun set. I knew this was our last big date but it didn't matter, I wasn't sad.
                I was happy I got to spend such a perfect day with such a perfect girl. I love you.

            <h1>Breakfast and Climbing</h1>
            <p>Our last real date together before you left for Hawai'i. We went to Streamliner Diner, our favorite breakfast spot to get
                some food and hot chocolate together. After our long week of cleaning and yard work preparing your house to be sold, we
                really could use some breakfast and relaxing... but instead of relaxing we went rock climbing! I had a lot of fun showing
                you a part of my life that I loved for so long. I had you drive over in the tesla and I made sure to laugh at you while
                you drove nervously. After climbing you went to hang out with isabella, I didn't realize that I'd have to drive the tesla
                home. I was even more nervous than you were so thank god you weren't with me. Even though this was a comparatively relaxed
                date it meant so much to me that we spent our last date together doing something I really wanted to do with you. I love you
                so much honey.
